Predicting soccer scores based on historical match data


Trying to make machine learning model that predict whether soccer match will be "boken" or no. Match is broken when team A 
is winning in half time but overall team B is winner. 

Firstli I collect matches data from website www.betexplorer.com by file match_parser.py and using selenium.

Now I'm trying to clear and preprocess data in break_analyzing.ipynb. For now i have problem with to much features.
I tried to decomposite features by PCA but my computer can't handle 17000 features. 

WORK IN PROGRESS.....
